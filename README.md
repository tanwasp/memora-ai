# Memora AI
Memora AI is a macOS desktop assistant that transforms how you learn and retain information. Highlight any text on your screen, invoke a shortcut, and ask questions. Memora remembers what youâ€™ve seen and builds a personal memory base, enabling smarter, more context-aware responses over time. It learns what you know, tracks what you struggle with, and helps generate intelligent notes and summaries automatically.
